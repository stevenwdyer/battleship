# Battleship

This project is a scaled-down recreation of the strategy game titled "Battleship". It utilizes two Arduinos that communicate to each other via UART, 3x3 LED matrices for grid visualization, joysticks for ship/shot selection, buttons for ship/shot confirmation, passive buzzers for audio cues, and 7-segment for score/state tracking.
